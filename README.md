## Description

This project is my project exam at Noroff where I was tasked to make a booking site called Holidaze.

Brief:
A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.

## Requirements

> All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API.
